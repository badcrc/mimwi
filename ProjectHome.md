An iPhone oriented web interface for Dartware's InterMapper monitoring tool.

It uses InterMapper Database to get data and the UiUIKit for the web interface layout.

It needs a web server with PHP and Postgresql support on it (InterMapper Database's db is Postgresql).

Still in beta but very functional imho.
